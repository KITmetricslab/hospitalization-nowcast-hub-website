### Contributing research groups

This platform is run by members of the [Chair of Statistics and Econometrics](https://statistik.econ.kit.edu/index.php) at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. Several other independent research groups contribute nowcasts:

- [Institute of Stochastics, TU Ilmenau](https://www.tu-ilmenau.de/stochastik/)

Moreover we display the most current nowcasts from the [weekly reports](https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Situationsberichte/Gesamt.html) of the Robert Koch Institute.
